2026-02-17 16:43:25,710 - orchestrator.4603928080 - WARNING - Inconsistent decision detected: HIGH risk_band=HIGH but should_alert=False. Routing to HITL. Decision: route='hitl_review' risk_band='HIGH' should_alert=False rationale='The risk score of 0.891 indicates a high risk situation, and the confidence level of 0.688 is below the threshold of 0.75. Therefore, a human operator must review the situation to make a final decision on the safety of the drone operation, as it is predicted to exceed the ceiling of 300 ft.'

Decision: route='hitl_review' risk_band='HIGH' should_alert=False rationale="The risk score of 0.915 indicates a high risk situation, necessitating a human operator's review for final decision-making. The predicted altitude of 312.0 ft exceeds the ceiling of 300.0 ft, which is a violation of FAA Part 107 regulations regarding altitude operations. Given the confidence level of 0.675, there is uncertainty in the risk assessment, further justifying the need for human intervention."
