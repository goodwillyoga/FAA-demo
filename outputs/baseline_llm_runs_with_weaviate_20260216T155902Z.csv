[S2] [docs/faa_guides/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf p.9] Remote Pilot – Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Study Guide 1 Introduction The information in this study guide was arranged according to the knowledge areas that are covered on the airman knowledge test for a Remote Pilot Certificate with a Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Rating as required by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 107, section 107.73(a) . The knowledge areas are as follows: 1. Applicable regulations relating to small unmanned aircraft system rating privileges, limitations, and flight operation; 2. Airspace classification, operating requirements, and flight restrictions affecting small unmanned aircraft operation; 3. Aviation weather sources and effects of weather on small unmanned aircraft performance; 4. Small unmanned aircraft loading; 5. Emergency procedures; 6. Crew resource management; 7. Radio communication procedures; 8. Determining the performance of small unmanned aircraft; 9. Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol; 10. Aeronautical decision-making and judgment; 11. Airport operations; and 12. Maintenance and preflight inspection procedures.

Most skeletal structures are supported by guy wires which are very difficult to see in good weather and can be invisible at dusk or during periods of reduced visibility. These wires can extend about 1,500 feet horizontally from a structure; therefore, all skeletal structures should be avoided horizontally by at least 2,000 feet.
